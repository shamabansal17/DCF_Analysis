# **Comprehensive Company Valuation: Forecasting Future Cash Flows and Assessing Enterprise Value**

### **Project Overview**

This project assesses a company's financial data to project future cash flows, calculate the present value of those cash flows, estimate the company's future worth, and ultimately determine its overall valuation. The analysis uses financial statements including the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. By forecasting free cash flows, calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), and computing the terminal value, the project aims to provide a comprehensive valuation of the company.
